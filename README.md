Quantized XOR Neural Network on STM32 MicrocontrollerThis repository contains a highly optimized implementation of an XOR Neural Network designed for the STM32F042K6 (ARM Cortex-M0). The project focuses on removing floating-point dependencies and utilizing hardware interrupts to achieve maximum efficiency in an embedded environment.🚀 Key FeaturesZero Floating-Point Dependency: Entirely implemented using Fixed-Point Arithmetic ($Q3.4$ format) to accommodate the lack of a hardware Floating Point Unit (FPU) on the Cortex-M0.Interrupt-Driven Architecture: Transitioned from inefficient "busy-waiting" polling to an asynchronous system using SysTick exceptions and ADC conversion interrupts.High Performance: Achieved a 15.9x reduction in execution time compared to standard floating-point implementations.🛠️ Technical ImplementationFixed-Point QuantizationSince the STM32F042K6 has limited flash (32KB) and no FPU, the model parameters and activation functions (ELU and Sigmoid) were converted to 8-bit quantized values ($int8\_t$).Activation Functions: Implemented via pre-computed Lookup Tables (LUTs) in nn.c for near-instantaneous execution.Precision Management: Used 16-bit intermediate casting during dot-product accumulations to prevent overflow before bit-shifting back to the target $Q$ format.System OptimizationThe project utilizes the NVIC (Nested Vector Interrupt Controller) to manage concurrent tasks:SysTick: Triggers a system exception every 100ms to initiate sampling.ADC Interrupts: The ADC is configured to trigger an ADC1_IRQHandler upon completion, allowing the CPU to remain idle or perform other tasks during the conversion process.Data Concurrency: Implemented __asm("CPSID I") and __asm("CPSIE I") blocks in main.c to protect shared variables (ch0, ch1) from race conditions during neural network inference.
